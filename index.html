                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript and VBScript.</p>
                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                <h1>Requirements</h1>
                <p>Before you start, we will discuss about the requirements for learning html.we are in the process to build an HTML page that contains a data capture feature.
                    I’ve been asked to provide my technical requirements.
                    since I’m a trainee and have no previous experience in such projects I’d like to have your advice in the requirements below.
                    Would anyone please check if I need to add/modify one of them.</p>
                <p>The list of requirements for learning Html is given below</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser</li>
                    <li>Text Editor</li>
                    <li>Dedication</li>

                <h1>Content</h1>
                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img  and  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
                <p></p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

                <h1>Advantages</h1>
                <p>HTML is very easy to learn and understand. For the one who is learning web development, HTML is the first and foremost language that the person will go through. It has simple tags and there is no hectic of case sensitivity in HTML. It simply has some tags that serve a specific purpose and that’s it. One can easily understand other’s code and can make changes in it if required as there is not a lot more to understand in it. Moreover, it does not throw any error or create any problem like other programming languages if the developer forgets to close the tags or make some mistakes in code.</p>
                <p>Almost all the browsers around the globe are supported by HTML. So there is no need to worry about the website written in HTML for the browser support as the website would easily show up in all the browsers if the program keeps in mind to optimize the website for the different browsers. HTML provides an easy way to optimize the website in HTML according to browsers to the web developers.</p>

                <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                <section>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");
                        </code>
                        <h3>Declaring Variable</h3>
                        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                        <code>var x = 42.</code>
                        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                        <code>x = 42.</code>
                        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                        <code> let y = 13.</code>
                        <h3>Constant</h3>
                        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
